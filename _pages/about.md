I am studying Cognitive Science, specializing in Artificial Cognition at Osnabrück University. Previously I obtained my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where I wrote my thesis with the Computer Science and Engineering Department.

I am broadly interested in working towards a more Dynamical Systems understanding of Machine Learning. Having worked on Reinforcement Learning projects extensively in the past, where Dynamics and Control are more intuitive, I wonder how these concepts can be carried over to other fields of Machine Learning. Recent advances in State Space Modelling that study latent dynamics also excite me.

I hope to explore and share more of my scientific journey on this page as I go through my Graduate studies.
